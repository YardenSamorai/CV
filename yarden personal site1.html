                    I am a computer science student Right now I'm a second year, I'm studying at the Institute of Technology in
                    Holon.<br>
                    I'm 25 years old, and I live in Rosh Ha'Ayin.<br>
                    All my life I've loved computers and wanted to focus on it throughout my life, I got to the point where I think I
                    can
                    start studying web development and promote my first project.
